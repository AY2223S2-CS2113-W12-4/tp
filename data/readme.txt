This is a shortened version of the movie database that is much easier to handle without using databases, and smaller file size for easier usage for our purposes.

In essence, we are limiting to only movies in 2010-2020 (avoiding newly created movies in 2023 and just to be safe, 2022-2021, which may cause differences in the files)

Removing adult movies and unnecessary columns as well.
