## Overview 

MovieMate is a desktop application to keep track of movies you have watched or want to watch.
You can additionally give a review to the movies you have watched. It also features ways search movies by name or genre.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it is written in Java.

### Summary of Contributions

**Contributions**
- I mostly helped to build the foundation of the code and overall project, including base classes and functionalities. This meant I had to
have a rough class structure in mind before we began.
  - On top of `Movie` class, I also helped make the `Review` class.
- I also prepared the movie database and trimmed it for our purposes.
  - This was done using Python code in the interest of time (as we had to get the data ready to start testing). However,
  given more time I could possibly convert the code to Java.
- GitHub Repository
  - I set up the repository and workflow (issues and milestones), as well as worked on build settings to include our database file with the JAR.
  - I also helped set up the GitHub page, modifying its configs and contributing quite a bit to the DG and UG.
    - Most of the DG was written by me.
    - I helped to re-format and migrate the UG from docs to markdown.
- I helped to coordinate team meetings and keep the team on track.
  - This includes assigning tasks (issues) and deadlines.
  - I made some PR reviews to maintain code standards.

Outside of the team project, I also tried to help my peers, and for peer reviews and PE-D bug testing I did submit above-average
number of reviews for both (and received notice of it in my email both times ^o^).

I may have posted a little in the forum, but outside of it, I also help my friends taking this module as well on
lecture contents and sharing useful tips.

You may find that my code contributions are larger at the start as I helped to set up the base code structure.
Near the end, I did slow down a little to work on documentation instead of code, as I felt I could offer
more help in writing, but still helped review PRs.
