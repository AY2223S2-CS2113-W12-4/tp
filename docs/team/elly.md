## Project: MovieMate

MovieMate is a desktop movie application used saving your own watched list and to-watch list. 
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to generate random movies according to the genre entered by the user.
    * What it does: Get the genre entered by the user and display some random movies that fall in the genre to the user. 
    * Justification: This feature improves the user experience when the user does not know which movie to watch. 
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: View detail of a movie.
    * What it does: Allow the user to view detail by entering a movie name, or index in the user's movie lists.
    * Justification: This feature improves the user experience when the user would like to view the detail of a movie for further action.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
